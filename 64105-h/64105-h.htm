<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> read through with great interest the
manuscript of this little book, and can say of
those parts of South America which it has been
my privilege to visit that Mrs Hodge writes as
one who has personal knowledge of the various
mission stations. I trust that her words will
not only reach the children, but also all who
love children, that what little is being done to
make their lot brighter may be strengthened,
and much more undertaken, so that where now
there are superstition and darkness there may
be knowledge and light.</p>

<p>For the natural world, God said: &#8220;Let there
be light, and there <i>was</i> light.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the spiritual world, Jesus said: &#8220;I am<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
the Light&#8221;; and because He meant to work
through us, He also said: &#8220;<span class="smcap">Ye</span> are the light
of the world.... Let your light so shine
before men that they may see your good
works, and glorify your Father which is in
heaven.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Young Friends</span>,</p>

<p>This little book has been written expressly
for you, to whom South America is an
entirely new field. On this account I feel it
is necessary to devote Chapter I. to the continent
itself before proceeding to acquaint you
with its youthful inhabitants.</p>

<p>I tender my grateful thanks to the South
American Missionary Society, the Evangelical
Union of South America, the Inland-South
America Missionary Union, and the Bolivian
Indian Mission for the help their publications
have afforded me in trying to place before
you something of the sorrows and intense need
of South American childhood.</p>

<small>A PEEP AT THE CONTINENT</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">South America</span> is a tremendous continent in
the Western Hemisphere, and occupies one-eighth
of the land surface of the world.</p>

<p>By looking at this chart you will get some
little idea as to the size of it, by comparing
it with other countries. South America, you
will therefore see, is twice the size of Europe,
three times the size of China, four times the
size of India, and sixty times the size of our
British Isles.</p>

<p>From Panama, at the extreme north, to the
furthest southern point of Tierra-del-Fuego
(&#8220;the Land of Fire&#8221;), it is about 4700 miles<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
in length, and it is 3000 miles from east to
west.</p>

<p>South America (leaving out the three
northern Guianas) is divided up into eleven
countries, or rather republics, each republic
being under its own president.</p>

<p>The names of the republics are:&mdash;</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" summary="table">

<tr><td>Brazil</td><td>     Venezuela</td></tr>
<tr><td>Argentina &nbsp; &nbsp; </td><td>   Chili</td></tr>
<tr><td>Peru</td><td>     Colombia</td></tr>
<tr><td>Bolivia</td><td>    Paraguay</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ecuador</td><td>    Uruguay and Panama</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Everything in South America is on a large
scale&mdash;rivers, forests, mountains, and plains.
There is the mighty River Amazon, with its
many tributaries, flowing through Northern
Peru and Brazil; the Orinoco, in Venezuela;
the Araguaya, in Brazil; and the River Plate,
which runs through the Republic of Argentina.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_012.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">AN AMAZONIAN CREEK</p>

<p>I hope you will study a map as we go
along. If you look on the western side of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
continent you will see a long range of mountains,
called the Andes, tipped with sleeping
volcanic fires on some, and capped by perpetual
snow on others. Nestling away up
among these rugged peaks is the highest body
of water in the world, called Lake Titicaca, on
which float the rush-boats of the Inca Indians,
the silent and down-trodden &#8220;Children of the
Sun.&#8221;</p>

<p>How vast China seems; and India, too,
how big! Africa we feel we know very little
about as yet, in spite of Livingstone and all
the books that have been written; but here
is South America&mdash;so neglected, and so large,
that there is more unexplored territory there
than in any other part of the world.</p>

<p>Not only so, but the continent is teeming
with treasure. Diamonds and gold are hidden
away in the earth in Brazil and Peru. Bolivia
is a vast storehouse of silver and tin and
coal. Petroleum and fertilizing nitrates for
cleansing the soil are to be found in Chili.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
The forests of Peru and Brazil spell rubber&mdash;&#8220;black
gold&#8221; it is called by the natives.
Chinchona trees flourish in abundance in Peru;
also cocaine, which the Indians chew from
morning till night, to deaden their sufferings,
and their hunger.</p>

<p>Although South America is so large, there
are, roughly speaking, only about fifty million
people living in it, but the population increases
every year through immigrants of all nations
pouring into the continent.</p>

<p>Five hundred years ago, South America was
the Indian&#8217;s land. In the heart of the continent
dwelt the savages, but Peru was the
home of the highly-civilized Inca race. To
the north lived an Indian people called the
Chibchas, who came next in culture; and
south, in Chili and Argentina, were the Araucanian
Indians, who were not so cultured as
the Incas or Chibchas, but who, notwithstanding,
were a powerful people.</p>

<p>About five hundred years ago the Pope, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
his arrogance, &#8220;gave&#8221; South America to the
two Roman Catholic countries of Spain and
Portugal. It was a dark day for that land
when the Portuguese adventurers and their
priests went to Brazil, and Pizarro and his
Spanish followers to Peru, the home of the
cruel Inquisition.</p>

<p>From that day onward slavery, ill-treatment,
and cruel deaths have been the lot of the
Indians. La Casas, a Roman Catholic official,
more humane than his brethren, was so concerned
at the lot of the Indians in Brazil that
he suggested that Africans should be brought
to help the Indians in the gold mines, and they
too suffered from the hands of the merciless
Portuguese. Hence, to-day, we see in Brazil
the negroes (of whom there are said to be some
four millions), the Indians, and the Portuguese-speaking
people of many nations, comprising
about twenty millions.</p>

<p>In Central and Southern Argentina the
population is chiefly European. Buenos Aires,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
the capital, is largely Italian, though a very
large number of British folk are living there.
In Peru nearly three-fourths of the people are
pure Indian, and Bolivia is mostly Indian as
well.</p>

<p>For five long centuries this has indeed been
the Land of Darkness and of the &#8220;Christless
Cross.&#8221; Two thousand years ago, nearly,
Christ said to the Apostle Peter: &#8220;Feed My
lambs.&#8221; What have the so-called followers of
Peter done for the Lambs of South America?
Let us see.</p>

<small>BRAZILIAN BROWNIES</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Entering</span> the mouth of the mighty River
Amazon, we travel slowly by steamer right
away through Northern Brazil, past Manaos,
with wonderful forests on either side of us.
How hot and stifling it is, for we are journeying
through the Tropics!</p>

<p>On we go, gliding past the crocodiles that
lie basking in the sun, and that lazily open one
eye at us or a huge mouth, the sight making
us shudder, but with a sense of devout thankfulness
that we are at a respectable distance!
No sound disturbs the quiet, except the ripple
of the water, and the screams of gaily-coloured
parrots. Now and again we hear a sound like
human voices, and straining our ears to listen
we find to our amusement that it comes from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
monkeys chattering and quarrelling among
themselves.</p>

<p>At length we branch off into one of the many
tributaries of the great river, the Yavari
for choice, which brings us to the borders of
Peru. Pitching our tent on the river-bank,
we settle down for a quiet evening. In front
of us is the Yavari River, filled with many
wonderful varieties of fish.</p>

<p>Stretching away behind us is the forest, full
of strange and wonderful things. We are in
the home of the wild Indians, of whom there
are many, many tribes. They live by fishing
in the river, and hunting in the forest. There
are said to be one hundred different kinds of
fish, the largest of which is the King Herring,
weighing often as much as three hundred-weight.
When one gets weary of fish diet,
stewed monkey makes a pleasant variety,
and cooked alligator a nice change!</p>

<p>Darkness has now fallen, and the stars are
out. No sound now but the humming of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
mosquitoes, which are the bane of the traveller&#8217;s
life in South America. Here in this great land
even the insects are on a large scale. Spiders,
jiggers, carrapatoes, ticks, and other insects
threaten to disturb our reverie. So if we would
escape such unwelcome attentions from blood-thirsty
mosquitoes, we must take shelter
under a net. But not yet; the night is cooler
than the day, and the fire-flies are out, like
vivid electric sparks, darting about us as we
lie and watch and dream of Paradise.</p>

<p>By and by we fall asleep. Suddenly we
sit up, rubbing our eyes. What was that?
Listening, for we are wide awake now, we hear
a cry as of someone in distress. The dawn
has broken as suddenly as the darkness fell
last night. It always does so in the Tropics,
and the crying and wailing gradually die
away.</p>

<p>Presently we hear a splash, something small
and dark has been thrown into the river, and
drifts slowly in our direction. Straining our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
eyes to see what it is, we find to our horror
that it is a dear little brown baby, but quite
dead, and following in its wake is a huge
crocodile. Alas! Alas! Who is it that has
been so inhuman to a little child? We will
find out.</p>

<p>Like scouts through the trees we stealthily
creep along, hardly daring to breathe, and
never once speaking above a whisper. Hark!
What is that? It is the tramp of many feet,
and away in the distance, across an open track,
we see a company of naked Indians in charge
of men clad in European clothing.</p>

<p>In our eagerness to follow we almost stumble
over a brown form, lying so still. It is an
Indian woman, dead from a gun-shot wound,
and lying at the foot of the tree close by is a
little brown baby. We turn away from the
sickening sight, for the wee brownie&#8217;s brains
have been dashed out by one of the wicked
white men in charge of the Indian gang, now
quickly disappearing in the distance.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>But we must hurry on, or we will lose them.
By and by they reach the rubber plantation,
the place where the rubber-trees abound.
The Brazilian and Peruvian forests are full of
rubber, and for six months in the year (the
other six months the land is under water)
these trees are &#8220;bled&#8221;&mdash;as it is called&mdash;by
the Indians for their taskmasters. The rubber
trees grow in groups of 100 to 150, each tree
yielding on an average eleven pounds of the
grey, sticky juice.</p>

<p>Here the Indians, under pain of terrible
torture and death, were made to extract the
rubber. The method of doing so is by making
a V-shaped gash in the trunk, under which is
hung a little clay cup to catch the juice. To
each tree is this done in turn, and when the cups
are full they are emptied into a large cauldron
hanging on a tripod over a fire of pine-cones.</p>

<p>After going through a certain process, the
juice becomes a hard, congealed mass. This
raw rubber is carried on the backs of Indians,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
through the forest and over the mountains,
to the city of Iquitos, in Northern Peru; and
every year sufficient rubber is exported to
provide tyres for 300,000 motor-cars.</p>

<p>In order to produce this rubber, the Indians
have been hunted through the forests like wild
beasts, and have been made to obtain the
rubber under the threats and taunts of ignorant
and cruel white men from neighbouring republics.
The Indians have been allowed a
certain time to get a certain quantity of rubber,
and if it has not been forthcoming the
Indians&mdash;men, women, and girls&mdash;have been flogged,
put into stocks, starved, tortured, and tormented
to death.</p>

<p>Saddest and most cruel of all, the children
have not escaped, as we have already seen.
The mother has been killed because maybe
she was too ill or weary to walk any farther,
and her little ones, who would only be in the
way, have been either thrown into the river to
the alligators, or have had their heads smashed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
against the trees, or been thrown away into
the forest alive to be devoured by wild animals.</p>

<p>It was said to be a favourite pastime of some
of these so-called &#8220;civilized&#8221; (!) agents of the
rubber companies to sit round smoking, and
for a little diversion to have one or more of
these little brown children hung up on a tree,
and to shoot at them as a target&mdash;for sport!</p>

<p>Think of the agony of suffering of these
children, flogged by wicked men, and even
burned alive, in order to force them to tell
where their parents were hidden. If those
rubber-trees could only speak, what awful
secrets they would reveal! Every thousand
tons of rubber that have come to our own
Christian land have cost seven Indian lives!
Who knows, my young reader, what tragedy
lies behind even the india-rubber ball with
which you play so skilfully, and yet lose so
carelessly!</p>

<p>For ten long, weary years all this went on,
before we heard in England the wail of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
little brown children of the Brazilian and
Peruvian forests. Have the cries ceased?
God only knows, for the sounds are too far
away for us to catch them.</p>

<p>Now I want to introduce you to some more
Brazilian babies, but of a very different kind.
So we will leave this &#8220;Paradise of Satan,&#8221;
and travel in an easterly direction, which will
take us through the heart of the continent.</p>

<p>In the Amazon Valley there are many, many
tribes of savage Indians, who hide away as
we approach, thinking in their great fear that
we must be rubber-gatherers. Occasionally
we see a large space, where once stood an
Indian village, a place of ruins and desolation,
and along the tracks are human bones
lying bleached and dry, telling a silent, yet
eloquent story of what had been once living
forms.</p>

<p>We, too, must be careful as we journey along,
for the Indians near this rubber region we are
leaving behind are in a dangerous mood, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
there is much to be feared from their deadly
blow-pipes. One little prick from the poisoned
arrow, and we would be dead in a very few
seconds. So we will proceed cautiously.</p>

<p>As we get farther into the interior, we gradually
find the vegetation becoming more dense;
we enter the region of &#8220;Matto Grosso&#8221; (meaning,
in English, &#8220;Big Woods&#8221;), covering a
million square miles. You will see it on the
map, in the centre of the continent. This forest
swarms with monkeys, snakes, parrots, and
many kinds of beautiful birds.</p>

<p>Most wonderful of all the plants are the
exquisite orchids, which grow luxuriantly on
the moss-covered boughs in the gloomiest parts
of the dark forest. They are beautiful both in
shape and colour&mdash;pink, white, and yellow.
Some spotted, and others striped with crimson.</p>

<p>It may seem strange that such loveliness
should be hidden away from the eyes of all but
the God who made them, but it is the same
everywhere in this wonderful country. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
choicest flowers bloom unseen except by the
chance traveller, and the strangest animals
and birds hide in the most out-of-the-way
places. Some of the trees are fully two hundred
feet high, so that birds on the topmost branches
are safe from the hunter.</p>

<p>Right in the heart of the forest is a dead
silence; no animal life is to be seen, though
probably there are swarms of monkeys, birds,
and other creatures hidden away in the tree-tops.
Female monkeys usually carry their
babies on their backs or shoulders, though
sometimes they are carried on the breast with
the legs and arms clasped round the body.
They are very fond of Brazil nuts, several of
which grow in one large, round shell, and in
order to get at them the monkey beats the shell
against the bough until it breaks and scatters
the nuts upon the ground beneath.</p>

<p>South America has been spoken of as a
Christian country, and yet, here in Brazil,
which is large enough to include the whole of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
the United States, and France as well, we find
many tribes of savage Indians, each tribe
speaking its own language, but to whom no
messenger of the Gospel of the Lord Jesus
Christ has ever been sent.</p>

<p>Some of these tribes are large, some small,
many move about from place to place, and
others cannot be reached, so fearful are they
of showing themselves. It is, on this account,
exceedingly difficult to find out how many
Indians there are living in the continent.
There might be six millions, or the number
might possibly be nearer ten, no one can tell.
Tens of thousands have passed away without
ever having heard of the Saviour.</p>

<p>They have their witch-doctors and their
religious feasts, and they live in constant dread
of evil spirits. Those who have come in contact
with so-called civilized white people are none the
better for it. In fact we can say, without any
hesitation whatever, that &#8220;the last state of
these people is worse than the first&#8221;; for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
civilization without Christ is a far worse condition
than paganism.</p>

<p>Just a few words more about these Brazilian
Brownies before we make our way to the coast.
From its birth the Indian baby is seldom parted
from its mother, until it learns to walk. A few
days after baby is born mother takes it to
the plantation, protecting the little head from
the heat of the sun by a banana leaf. When on
a visit to distant relatives they take all their
goods and chattels with them; and when paddling
down the river the little ones help father to
row, while mother sits at the helm nursing baby.</p>

<p>While baby is very tiny mother carries her
in a broad, bark band which is hung over her
right shoulder. When baby grows bigger,
and is able to sit up by herself, she rides on
mother&#8217;s hip, supported by her encircling arm.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_028.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">BRAZILIAN BROWNIES FISHING</p>

<p>The Indians do not spoil their children,
although they are very fond of them. They
believe in hardening their little ones, so the
girls and boys are bathed by their careful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
mothers every day in cold water, in some shady
forest stream. Indian mothers are very fond
of playing with their children, and when a tiny
mite wants all her mother&#8217;s care the older ones
are handed over for &#8220;grannie&#8221; to look after.</p>

<p>Mother loves to deck her little one with
necklaces, only I do not think we should say
they were pretty, for they are made either of
teeth or seeds. If you want to make an Indian
woman your friend, nothing will win her friendship
quicker than a present of a bead necklace
to her little child.</p>

<p>Then no Indian mother thinks her little one&#8217;s
toilet is complete until she is painted red, though
I do not suppose we should think her at all
beautiful.</p>

<p>Girls soon begin to help their mothers in
various ways, by looking after the smaller ones,
netting hammocks, making pottery, spinning
cotton, and learning to cultivate the fields and
to cook. But &#8220;the children&#8217;s souls, which God
is calling Sunward, spin on blindly in the dark.&#8221;</p>

<small>BLOSSOM BABIES</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Leaving</span> our little Indian friends, we now make
our way through the State of Sao Paulo, in
South-Eastern Brazil, to the city of the same
name, which means &#8220;St Paul.&#8221; The climate
here is more temperate and healthy (except
in the lowlands near the sea-coast), which is
a pleasant change from the tropical heat of
Northern Brazil.</p>

<p>Sao Paulo is very up-to-date, and more like
a modern European city than any other in
Brazil. Yet although many of the Portuguese-speaking
people who live here are educated,
they are very ignorant of the true religion of the
Lord Jesus Christ. Their religion, like that
of the people in every other city in South
America, consists chiefly in the worship of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
woman, the Virgin Mary, and there are very
many Roman Catholic feasts given in her
honour during the year.</p>

<p>The mother of our Saviour is thus the object
of worship of many thousands of women and
children in South America to-day, and yet the
exaltation of the Virgin Mary has not by any
means uplifted these women and children;
on the contrary, their social, moral, and spiritual
state is worse than that of the women and
children of any heathen country. It is only
where the Lord Jesus Christ is worshipped
and upheld that mothers, sisters, and little
children are honoured, cared for, and put into
their proper place.</p>

<p>In South America the Lord Jesus is either
represented as a little child in His mother&#8217;s
arms, as on the cross, or as lying dead in a
coffin. As the Saviour is thus misrepresented
to them, it is perhaps not to be wondered at
that these women and children, who do not
know the truth about His love, turn away from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
the apparently dead Christ, to the warm,
kindly-looking, gaudily-decked figure of Mary,
about whom the Church of Rome says: &#8220;Come
unto Mary, all ye who are burdened and weary
with your sins, and she will give you rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is to Mary and not to the Lord Jesus that
the children of South America are bidden to
turn.</p>

<p>Think of your own happy childhood, of
mother and your bright home; of your church,
your Sunday-school, and your day-school; of
the bright, happy hours you spend in play;
of the laughing, chubby, clean, and healthy
children of our own cities. Think; and now
come with me through the city of Sao Paulo,
where we see people of all nations and colours,
from the blackest negro to the whitest European.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_032.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">PALMS, LILIES AND BABY BLOSSOMS</p>

<p>We will pay a visit to some bright, budding
blossoms of humanity who have been gathered
from streets and places of wickedness, and
planted in a beautiful Home standing in its
own grounds, lying on the outskirts of the town.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
Here thirty-six little human &#8220;blossoms&#8221; live
and flourish under the motherly and fatherly
care of Mr and Mrs Cooper, their daughter, and
other workers.</p>

<p>The story of the first &#8220;blossom&#8221; is that while
Mr and Mrs Cooper were doing missionary
work in another part of Brazil, a little baby
girl was given to them by her mother, who was
quite out of her mind. The poor wee mite was
little more than skin and bones, but loving care
and plenty of good food soon transformed her
into a bonnie maiden.</p>

<p>To describe all these thirty-six &#8220;blossoms&#8221;
would fill a book. The Blossom Home is one
of the brightest spots in Brazil to-day, and it
is a real joy to leave the city and to hurry
away at sunset over the low fields, with the
wide sky on all sides coloured always with
different hues, and the fresh, cool breath of
evening, while a bevy of expectant children
await your appearance under the pines and
palms of the walk to the house. That these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
little ones were ever poor, or diseased, or
homeless, does not seem possible as we mingle
with them at the evening play-hour.</p>

<p>That Tecla was ever anything but a sweet-faced
yellow-haired child, that Baby was
ever thin and wrinkled, that Bepy was ever
serious, or Rosa not always happy, seems so
long ago as not to belong to the present age
of the Home. One &#8220;blossom&#8221; came all the
way from Maranham, a city more than 2000
miles away from Sao Paulo, which shows
how much such orphanages are needed in
Brazil.</p>

<p>It would be nice to stay here and make
their further acquaintance, to see the little
ones in the kindergarten, and the older ones
at their lessons. It would be interesting to
spend a Sunday at this haven, and to see the
keen interest they display in missions and
missionaries.</p>

<p>During the week, at morning worship they
are trained to look out over the whole world,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
and to pray for a particular place each day.
At Sunday-school they, of their own accord,
have a collection amongst themselves, and
every week they try to do something extra,
for which they are paid, and out of this they
freely give to the missionary box. They send
to the child-widows of India, to the school
for blind children at Jerusalem, and to other
missions in which they are interested.</p>

<p>We would like to watch them, too, at their
work, for they are all busy little bees, and
what a hive of happy industry it is&mdash;dairying,
poultry-raising, laundry, kitchen, housework,
and gardening! The reason why we cannot
stay for more than a flying visit is because
there is no room for us, and if not for us, then
for no one else, for the Home is already more
than full.</p>

<p>&#8220;The girls&#8217; dormitories hold fourteen beds,
and there are twenty girls! Baby Grace
sleeps in a cot beside the bed of &#8216;Mother&#8217; and
&#8216;Daddy,&#8217; but the other five have to sleep in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
the dining-room, which means making up
beds at bedtime. The walls of the Home are
not made of india-rubber, so they cannot
be stretched to receive any more &#8216;blossoms.&#8217;
What is then to be done? Applications are
constantly coming in, a recent one being for
a motherless baby girl of a month old. How
the heart of Christ must yearn over these
little ones of whom He said when here on
earth: &#8216;Of such is the Kingdom of Heaven!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<small>PARAGUAYAN PICCANINNIES</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> next visit is to the Republic of Paraguay,
so, leaving Sao Paulo, we will travel in a
westerly direction, though really, in order to
reach Paraguay in the proper way we should
make our way to Santos, and embark on a
steamer for Buenos Aires, in Argentina, which
is situated at the mouth of the Silver River,
called by the Spanish-speaking people of
Argentina &#8220;Rio de la Plata.&#8221;</p>

<p>From Buenos Aires all missionaries travel
up this river to Paraguay, but as we are not
ordinary travellers, but extraordinary, we make
our way to the banks of the River Paraguay.
Here we must pause for a moment.
Behind us is civilization; before us is heathenism
and the unknown. Across the river lies<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
the &#8220;Gran Chaco&#8221; (Great Hunt), the Indian&#8217;s
land, about which one hears all kinds of queer
stories. There is something fascinating about
&#8220;an unknown people in an unknown land,&#8221;
and so curiosity prompts us to cross and
explore.</p>

<p>But it was something more than mere
curiosity which took Mr W. Barbrooke Grubb,
of the South American Missionary Society,
among the Lengua Indians&mdash;a burning desire
to tell these dusky people of a God of Love.
So one day this quiet, resolute Englishman,
with a purposeful air which reminded one
strangely of David Livingstone, walked into
the Indian encampment, letting them know
by his manner that he had come to stay.</p>

<p>Still it is with the little people we wish to
make friends. So climbing into a bullock-cart&mdash;for
we are now on the other side of the
river&mdash;we make our way slowly across swampy
plains until we come to a palm forest, where
some Lengua Indians are encamped. Boys<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
and girls with browny-red skin, black eyes,
and long black hair are playing about just
like English children&mdash;only they are not
very merry or full of fun, but are, oh, so
dirty!</p>

<p>The boys have one garment, a little blanket
of many patterns and colours, which is twisted
round the waist in the hot weather, but worn
round the shoulders when cold. They deck
themselves with ostrich feathers, bead necklaces,
shells, and sheep&#8217;s teeth. The feathers
are worn in the hair; also round the ankles,
to protect them from the biting of the snakes
which lurk in the long grass.</p>

<p>The girls also have one garment, a skirt
made of deer skin. They, too, wear beads and
other ornaments like their brothers, though
they are not decked out like the boys.</p>

<p>Leaving our bullock-cart, we walk right
into the camp. What queer houses the people
live in! Just a few branches of trees stuck
in the ground, with some palm leaves and a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
handful of grass on the top. There are no
windows or doors, and no furniture inside,
but just a few deer skins on the ground, which
serve as beds. Everything is put on the
ground, for there are no shelves or cupboards,
and all looks dirty and untidy.</p>

<p>Presently the father comes in from the hunt,
bringing an animal which he has killed with
his bow and arrow. Sometimes he brings a
deer, an ostrich, or a wild pig. To-night it is
an ostrich. He drops his load a little way off,
and the women and children go and bring it
in. It is supper-time, and they are all hungry.
First they take off the skin carefully, for that
will make a new skirt for the little girl, or a
bed for her brother.</p>

<p>Everyone now works hard. Boys and girls
fetch water and wood, and fan up the fire.
Soon the meat in the pot is cooked, and the
children pass the word round that supper is
ready. The pot is lifted off the fire, everybody
sits on the ground in a circle round<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
it, and they get out their horn spoons, though
generally they use their fingers.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_040.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">A PARAGUAYAN CHRISTIAN FAMILY</p>

<p>Each child gets a large piece of meat in its
hands. There is no waiting, no blessing asked,
but all eat until everything is finished, while
the crowd of hungry dogs around try to steal
pieces out of the pot.</p>

<p>Then the pipe is passed round; and the
father tells how he saw the ostrich, how he
dressed himself up with leaves and twigs to
look like a tree and stalked the bird. Presently
he got near enough to shoot it with his
arrow. He tells also how, in coming home,
he saw a tiger in the forest, and later on killed
a snake. It is a long, long story, but the
children listen eagerly, and next day they
act it all over in their play.</p>

<p>Now it is bedtime. If we were Indians
we would all choose a place as near the fire
as possible, not so much for the warmth,
as to escape the unwelcome attentions of
our diminutive friends, the mosquitoes. We<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
would spread out our little skin beds, or if
you had not one of your own, you would
cuddle up with the other children, always
putting the tiny tots and any sick ones in
the middle. And while you are in slumberland
the dogs crouch near. Over you spreads
the blue sky, with the beautiful moon shining
down upon you in company with the myriad
stars.</p>

<p>But you will not sleep for long: a weird cry
rings out through the silent night, the cry of
some animal or bird, and, starting up in a
frightened way, the Indian shakes his rattle
to frighten away the evil spirit.</p>

<p>The fire has to be kept up all night while
the children sleep, and the dogs must be
watched in case they try to reach the tasty
piece of ostrich hung up in the neighbouring
tree for breakfast. You will probably be disturbed,
too, by the barking of wolves or the snarl
of a tiger, as they prowl round the encampment.</p>

<p>In the morning everybody is on the move,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
for these Lengua Indians do not stay long in
one place. Pots and pans are collected, together
with gourds and skins, and put into
big nets which the women are expected to
carry. The men go on in front with their
bows and arrows, so that they may be ready
for any dangers, such as tigers, or to shoot
any game for food.</p>

<p>Three children can ride astride a horse or
mule, although it is exceptional for an Indian
to have either; or a mother and two little
ones can travel thus&mdash;one tied in front and
one behind round her waist. But very often
you would have to walk on and on, through
swamps and over wide, hot plains, always on
the look-out for something to eat.</p>

<p>Sometimes there is no water, and the
children are only too glad to stoop and scrape
up the muddy dregs in the print of a horse&#8217;s
hoof, or else they look for the caraguata plant,
which generally has a little water at the bottom
of its long, prickly leaves.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>On the sandy plains there are tiny insects
which burrow into the feet, and make them
swell until they are very, very sore. Sometimes
so many of these insects get in that you
can scarcely walk at all.</p>

<p>All at once someone catches sight of a herd
of wild pigs feeding; then away go our little
Indian friends, snatching up sticks, to chase
and if they can to capture a pig.</p>

<p>At night-fall another halt is made, this
time by a stream, for there are fish and alligators
to make a splendid meal. So all the
things are unpacked, and the houses of twigs
and leaves are soon erected. A big fire is
kindled, and after an &#8220;alligator&#8221; supper,
quiet once more reigns in the camp as another
night falls, wooing the Chaco children to
sleep under the twinkling stars.</p>

<p>The Lengua Indians are very fond of their
children, but they seldom correct them when
they are naughty. If mother should attempt
to correct them, father very unwisely interferes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
so I am afraid a great many Chaco
children are spoilt.</p>

<p>When Mr W. Barbrooke Grubb came to the
Gran Chaco the Indians showed him plainly
by their manner that they did not want him.
This, however, did not discourage him in the
least, but only spurred him on to try to win
their favour. He made himself one with
them; he learned their customs and their
language; he travelled when they travelled,
took part in their feasts, and lived exactly as
they did&mdash;until finally he won their confidence
and love. How they needed the Gospel, for
they were in gross heathen darkness! They
had no religious customs, though they had
their witch-doctors, and lived in constant
dread of evil spirits.</p>

<p>Amongst the Indians here &#8220;baby-killing,&#8221;
which grown-up people call &#8220;infanticide,&#8221; is
sadly very common. &#8220;Superstition,&#8221; writes
Mr Grubb, &#8220;causes many of these deaths.
Girl babies, if they are born first, are put to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
death; deformed children are also killed,
and twins are never allowed to live. Many
die through want of care during the first
years of childhood.&#8221;</p>

<p>How heartless such customs seem! Yet
there is something still more sad, which has
to do with their beliefs. For many years Mr
Grubb tried to show the Indians &#8220;the better
way,&#8221; and to do away with the cruel practice
of killing their babies.</p>

<p>Their burial rites are very weird, and no
funeral ever takes place after sunset. If,
therefore, a sick Indian is likely to die in the
night, before sunrise, they bury her or him
before the sun goes down, even though the
spirit may not have left the body, break up
their camp, and move away before they settle
down for the night.</p>

<p>The mother of a dear little Indian girl
became very ill one day. The husband, who
really loved his wife, did all he could to make
her well, but in spite of this she gradually<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
grew worse instead of better. When he saw
that she could not possibly live, and that all
hope was gone he left her alone.</p>

<p>There she lay, outside the hut, with a reed
matting over her face, her life fast ebbing
away. It was about an hour before sunset.
The Indians were getting restless, when the
missionary walked into their midst. Seeing
the form on the ground, he stooped down,
taking the matting from the Indian woman&#8217;s
face.</p>

<p>She whispered: &#8220;Water.&#8221; Reluctantly it
was brought by the Indian husband, but a
few minutes later she became quite unconscious.
The eyes of the Indians were anxiously
looking, not towards the dying woman, but
toward the sinking sun, for she must be buried
before sunset. They would all have to pack
up and hurry away to a new camping place,
where the woman&#8217;s spirit could not follow.</p>

<p>Impatiently they stepped forward, but
were waved back by the missionary. Her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
grave was ready, everything was prepared
for the funeral rites.</p>

<p>&#8220;The spirit has not left her yet,&#8221; he said;
&#8220;do not touch her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But we must hasten, or darkness will be
upon us before we leave,&#8221; replied the husband;
&#8220;we cannot break our custom.&#8221;</p>

<p>The missionary held them off as long as he
could, till finally they bore her away. Stepping
into their hut, he heard a faint noise,
and seeing a small, dark object on the floor,
he stooped down and tenderly lifted up the
now motherless baby girl. What a dear, wee,
brown living thing she was!</p>

<p>Turning round he saw her father, who held
out his arms saying that he had come to take
her away to be buried with her mother. The
missionary gazed at him with horror in his
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but you are not going to kill her,
surely?&#8221; said he, hugging Baby closer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not,&#8221; said the father; &#8220;we are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
going to put her in the ground alive. It is our
custom!&#8221;</p>

<p>He did not think about the cruelty of such
a proceeding. It was part of their religion,
and, therefore, must be carried out. So there
was a tussle between the father and the missionary
for the Chaco baby&#8217;s life, and I am glad to
say the missionary won, but the Indians did
not like it at all.</p>

<p>The first thing to be considered was what to
give baby to eat, and the second problem how
to get her to the mission-station a hundred
miles away. Finding that no Indian woman
would help him in the matter of nursing and
feeding her, he saw that he would have to be
both mother and nurse to her himself.</p>

<p>What could he give &#8220;Brownie&#8221;? Well,
God showed him what to do, so she was kept
alive on rice water and goat&#8217;s milk, which the
missionary gently squirted into her mouth from
his mouth, and on egg and milk, these being the
chief items in Baby&#8217;s diet.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>After miles and days of riding on horseback,
with five Indians to show the missionary the
way, they at length reached the mission-station,
and Baby was handed over to a kind motherly
missionary. I am sorry to say, however, that
Baby Hope (for that is the name the missionaries
gave her), was taken ill six months afterwards,
and died, and she was laid to rest on the banks
of the River Paraguay.</p>

<p>How sad it is to think that there have been
many of these little ones who were not so
fortunate in being rescued from a living grave
like Baby Hope! But these Indians are learning
that Jesus loves the little children in the
Chaco. For nearly thirty years the missionaries
of the South American Missionary Society have
been working here for the preserving and uplifting
of the children, and to-day they are being
rewarded by seeing many Christian Indian
homes established.</p>

<p>There are day-schools, Sunday-schools, and
schools of industry where the older boys and girls<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
are learning how to become useful men and
women. Carpentering, house-building, agriculture,
cooking, laundry, and housework are
now taking the place of wandering, hunting,
dancing, and feasting, which, with them, have
now become things of the past.</p>

<p>There are many other Indian tribes in Paraguay
yet to be reached, so we will leave the
Gran Chaco, and once more crossing the river
we come back to civilization&mdash;but not to stay,
our destination being Santa Teresa, in South-Eastern
Paraguay. We must travel on horseback
now, for there are no smooth roads; so,
accompanied by Mr John Hay, of the Inland-South
America Missionary Union, we proceed
on our journey. For the benefit of those who
did not go with him he wrote an account of his
experiences. In his diary he says:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;When we entered the dense forests the
Indian tracks soon became impassable for men
on horseback. We could no longer ride, and
in some places we were obliged to travel barefoot,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
in deep mud, leading our horses as best we
could, while we stumbled on over the roots of
trees and interlacing bamboo creepers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Led by a native guide, we found the Indians
hidden away behind the shelter of almost impassable
swamps, across which we could not
take our horses&mdash;amid the most savage conditions,
and in great poverty. Some of them
had a little maize, but for the most part they
appeared to live on wild fruits, roots, reptiles,
caterpillars, or anything procurable by hunting
and fishing. For clothing, they wore only loin-cloths,
and bands of women&#8217;s hair twisted round
the legs below the knees and round the wrists.</p>

<p>&#8220;Their faces were painted in curious patterns,
with some black pigment, and in some cases
mutilated by a hole in the lower lip, through
which a long appendage of resinous gum protruded,
hanging down in front of the chin.
They were armed with long powerful bows,
from which they can shoot, with deadly effect,
arrows pointed with long, hard, wooden barbs.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
Some of these arrows measure over six feet in
length.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some of the women were busily weaving
their little loin-cloths, made from fine cotton
fibre, on rude square frames made with four
branches of a tree firmly fixed in the ground.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is to these Indians and their little children
that Mr Hay and his fellow-workers seek to
minister. A mission-station has been built
here in the wilds, under tremendous difficulties
and very trying conditions. &#8220;The Indians
are scattered in very small companies, sometimes
merely families, over immense areas;
they are constantly moving their dwellings&#8221;&mdash;their
chief idea being to get away from the one
they think their greatest enemy&mdash;the white
man!</p>

<p>It has, therefore, been uphill work to win the
confidence of these Indians; but God, who
is always on the side of the missionaries, has
rewarded their patient, prayerful, and persevering
efforts, so that now quite a number of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
Indians, recognizing the missionaries as their
friends, are seeking them out. At one time,
when the maize and mandioca crops failed,
the people had to eat rats and wild animals of
the forest. The missionaries gave them work
to do and paid them in food. &#8220;At first they
were very shy, especially the women, but as
they got to know them their shyness wore off,
and even the little children began to feel at home
with them.&#8221;</p>

<p>It will take us too long to visit the other
I.S.A.M.U. Stations. If we had time we could
go to Caaguazw, the base from which the
missionaries work among the Forest Indians;
to Villarica, the third city in Paraguay, where
there is a school for the children of English-speaking
people, and where the Roman Catholic
officials have warned their people not to send
their children to the Protestant schools, for
Rome prefers to keep her little ones ignorant.</p>

<p>Had we time to linger in Concepcion, the
second city of the republic, situated on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
River Paraguay, with its 14,000 inhabitants,
we should be able to learn something of the
missionary work carried on there amongst the
children. Here as elsewhere, the Roman
Catholic priests are very hostile, and do all
they can to hinder the work of Christ amongst
these little ones.</p>

<p>Just before we leave Paraguay, we must have
a peep at the children who are not Indians,
but the natives of the country. The Paraguayan
children go about naked from three
to four years of age until they go to school;
the Paraguayans of the town are, of course,
better dressed. The boys are very fond of
hunting birds, with bows and marbles of hard
clay. These bows have two strings each, with
a little rag on the strings on which the marble
is placed. It shoots a good distance, and can
kill good-sized birds.</p>

<p>The Paraguayans, like other peoples, have
bad habits&mdash;such as drinking, card-playing,
swearing, and smoking. Even little boys of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
three and four years of age are sometimes seen
smoking, while their parents just look on and
smile! Alas, that this religion of &#8220;baptized
paganism&#8221; should prevail everywhere, and
that the boys and girls of Paraguay should be
bought and sold to Paraguayan masters to be
their slaves!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br />


<small>ARGENTINE ALL-SORTS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Argentina</span>, the Land of the Silver River, is,
after Brazil, the next Republic in size in South
America. It is the most progressive from a
worldly point of view, and from a spiritual
standpoint also it is going forward steadily.</p>

<p>This is not strange, seeing that the people
who live in Central and Southern Argentina
are mainly European, and British people have
an enormous commercial and financial interest
in that land; but nevertheless we cannot get
away from the fact that this Land of the Silver
River lacks in many places the streams of Living
Water which God is so patiently waiting to
flood through human channels to hundreds of
girls and boys who do not know Him. We
should really, therefore, take a very great interest
in Argentina for more than one reason.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>From Paraguay we will make a journey into
Northern Argentina. Travelling through the
sugar plantations, we finally reach San Pedro,
where the sugar-crushing mills are at work,
for it is harvest time and hundreds of Indians
are employed cutting the cane.</p>

<p>Everything is in full swing, and dusky forms
are flitting here, there, and everywhere, some
cutting the cane with long knives, while the
Indian women carry it away and lay it in heaps.
Here, after the leaves and top ends are cut off,
the cane is thrown into trucks, which are taken
to the factory by a small engine drawing twelve
or thirteen trucks. We will go and see how
the cane goes in at one end and nice white sugar
comes out at the other end. The sugar, after
being sewn up in bags, is taken away in big,
heavy carts, with high broad wheels.</p>

<p>At another sugar plantation 3000 Indians
are employed. They come from Southern
Bolivia and the Gran Chaco to work from three
to five months among the sugar cane, and then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
return to their own country. There are several
tribes, the most civilized being the Chiriguards
from Bolivia, who are cleaner and more intelligent
than the rest. There are the Tobas, another
warlike tribe, who go about almost naked.
They are dirty and savage looking. Also the
Matacos, who are sadder looking than the rest.</p>

<p>The South American Missionary Society is
endeavouring to reach these people in San
Pedro and San Antonio. Mr R. J. Hunt says,
of his second visit amongst the Indians in the
Argentine Chaco:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;A day or two after my arrival I went to
the village seeking my assistant, Sixto, and
found the house deserted and the household
goods removed. Glancing in and out among
the trees, I found all the huts likewise vacated,
but presently I espied two solitary little girls
of six or seven years of age playing near one
of the huts; and on approaching, instead of
scampering away like frightened animals, they
remained quite still, and shyly but very clearly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
explained to me, with many gestures, that the
man whom I sought had built another house
on the other side of the road. Only those who
have attempted to tame one, know the wild,
shy nature of a little Indian girl!</p>

<p>&#8220;The other day I went to visit the Mataco
Camp at Mira Flores, and at the sound of my
voice a young fellow came forward with a broad
smile on his face and saluted me. A little
girl instantly sidled up to me, and immediately
from several huts came the women to smile
recognition of me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then the men flocked round. I speak
specially about the women, because their rule
is that when a stranger visits their camp the
women keep in the background, or peep out
through their well-ventilated grass-huts; but
these people were from Tres Pozos, and they
had seen me squatting round their fires,
and moving freely in and out among their
friends. I was no longer a stranger but one of
themselves.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>We will now make our way southward through
Argentina, travelling for many miles from one
city to another by mule back. They are inhabited
by children of all nations, but speaking
the one common language of Spanish. These
cities have their churches, convents and
cathedrals, and everywhere you see priests
and so-called &#8220;holy&#8221; women.</p>

<p>In Cordoba, the Brethren are doing a splendid
missionary work. Mr and Mrs Will Payne and
their children, with Miss Emily Reynolds, and
others are seeking to win the children to Christ.</p>

<p>A priest was holding a service at one of
the Roman Catholic churches. Amongst other
things he promised everyone present that
evening seven years&#8217; release from purgatory
for their attendance at the service! A rich
young lady promised candles to one of the
Virgins, if her prayers were answered.</p>

<p>In the Sunday-school work only the better-class
children are being reached, as for the most
part the poor children live so far away.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>In San Martin, a village near Cordoba, a
little Sunday-morning school has been started.
There are always a few listeners at the door,
who are afraid to come in. When invited to
enter they say: &#8220;No, I must not, you are
heretics!&#8221; One of the Sunday-school boys,
who attended a day-school under the supervision
of Roman Catholics, was expelled because
it was discovered that he attended the little
morning Sunday-school.</p>

<p>How helpless the missionaries are in matters
like these! For the power of Rome is very
great in these fanatical places. But this little
difficulty was speedily removed, for a Spanish
woman who had recently come from Spain
had been a day-school teacher before her
marriage in a missionary school in Spain! She
felt constrained to open a day-school here, and
so the children who attended the Sunday-school
went also to the day-school.</p>

<p>Best of all the Word of God is read and
taught every morning for half an hour. How<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
true the proverb is: &#8220;What you put into the
life of a nation, you must put into its schools.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was an orphan school kept by a few
Christians who loved little children, a few
miles out of Cordoba. A little boy was very
ill, dying of consumption; and he was brought
to a hospital in the city. The little fellow
knew the Gospel, and had his Testament with
him. His precious Book was taken away from
him; and although he was so ill he was given
no peace till he was driven to confess to a
priest and renounce the Gospel.</p>

<p>Then they tried to stop the missionary&#8217;s
visits, but, in defiance of the Catholic nurse,
and on the ground that the missionary had
brought up the orphan child, she got through
to see him before he died.</p>

<p>Children take part in the religious festivals
of the Roman Church, especially the feasts of
the Virgin, of which there are very many. One
of the chief festivals is that of the &#8220;Virgin
Mercedes.&#8221; The image is taken out of the great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
Church that bears her name, in order that,
according to an ancient custom, she may release
four prisoners.</p>

<p>This Virgin is reckoned to be very miraculous.
She is supposed, years ago, to have given special
victory in an Argentine battle. In commemoration
of this, every year she is solemnly taken
down from her niche, and paraded with great
pomp to release any four prisoners she chooses.</p>

<p>Let us turn aside and see this great sight.
The route of the procession is lined, almost
packed, with people. Cordoba being a large
and so-called religious city, practically everybody
is out to watch with us. At last we see
the procession; it is slowly returning to the
church. How long it is! For we find by our
watches that it has taken twenty minutes
to pass.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_064.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">A CONVENTILLO IN THE ARGENTINE CAPITAL</p>

<p>Heads are bared as the robed priests and
choir boys, with lights and lanterns, come
into view. Such crowds of women follow!
Little children dressed in white follow on,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
carrying silk banners. At length, to the
muffled sound of the drum, and well protected
by armed soldiers, comes the Virgin, carried
aloft.</p>

<p>The excitement is now at its highest.
Women are throwing flowers from the balconies
to the Virgin. All are anxious to
catch sight of the four prisoners at whose
feet the Virgin had been made to drop a free
pardon. Then follow in the rear more soldiers
as a further escort.</p>

<p>In spite of all these feasts, the priests feel
they are losing their hold upon the people,
especially the women; and in order to revive
religious sentiment cinematograph pictures
are being shown in one of the churches to
attract more worshippers. To lose the women
is also to lose the children, the men they have
already lost.</p>

<p>On our way to the capital of Buenos Aires,
we pass miles of waving corn, with great expanses
of grassland upon which graze hundreds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
of sheep and cattle. Here and there, too, we
see ranches where the owners of the wheat-fields
and cattle live.</p>

<p>Who are these people? Not foreigners,
but our own British men and women, miles
away from any city and from civilization.</p>

<p>There is no church for them to go to, so
Sunday is the same as any other day; but
occasionally they receive a visit from the
chaplain of the South American Missionary
Society. More often than not, they are without
any spiritual help whatever, and yet how
much we owe to them!</p>

<p>Supposing we had no church or Sunday-school,
no one to tell us of the beautiful
things of God&mdash;how we should miss it all!
And yet here are these people living out on
the plains of Argentina, with their little
children, tending the sheep, and reaping the
corn, all of which is for our material benefit.</p>

<p>The sheep and cattle are killed and put into
the freezing-houses in Buenos Aires; the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
wheat is harvested and made into flour, and
all is shipped from the docks every week, to
England and other parts of the world. Shall
we not send them news of the Bread of Life
which perisheth not, so that the boys and
girls of Argentina may know about the Lord
Jesus Christ?</p>

<p>Now we are in <i>the</i> city of the whole continent,
Buenos Aires. The houses are flat-roofed
and have no chimneys, for the very
simple reason that they have no fires. Most
of the cooking is done either on a charcoal
brazier or on a gas or oil stove. Most of the
streets are very narrow, especially the older
ones. The newer streets are made much
wider, and down the centre are avenues of
trees.</p>

<p>House rent here, as in every other South
American city, is very, very high, so that the
poor people live in &#8220;conventillos&#8221; such as
you see here. &#8220;This is a form of slum peculiar
to South America consisting of a square, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
courtyard surrounded by buildings one or
two stories high. A &#8216;conventillo&#8217; sometimes
contains as many as a hundred families, each
one crowded into a single room, opening on
to the common square. Here the women
wash, and cook, and sew, and gossip and
drink &#8216;mat&eacute;&#8217; with their friends (the native
tea of the continent is grown in Paraguay).
Here also the children swarm and quarrel at
their games.&#8221;</p>

<p>Buenos Aires is a most cosmopolitan city,
full of life, gaiety, and commercial activity;
and yet so full of wickedness that many a
mother&#8217;s boy has been ruined for eternity.</p>

<p>There are numerous factories of various
kinds in the city and neighbourhood, in which
hundreds of girls and boys are employed. In
the richer homes the girls are kept very
secluded by their mothers, having no purpose
in life but just to dress up and make themselves
look nice.</p>

<p>In the hot months everyone rises with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
sun, and the first substantial meal, called
&#8220;almuorzo&#8221; (breakfast) is taken at 11.30.
The hottest part of the day is spent in &#8220;siesta&#8221;
(sleep), under a mosquito net, on a shady
verandah, after which you have a cold bath
and dress ready for visitors, or go visiting
yourself.</p>

<p>To speak of work amongst children in the
Province of Buenos Aires would fill a book.
The Christian workers of the Evangelical
Union of South America are doing noble work
in the Sunday-schools. We have not time
to visit Tres Arroyos, where each Sunday
two hundred children listen to the &#8220;Old, Old
Story of Jesus and His Love,&#8221; or Las Flores,
Coronel Suarez, Campana, or San Fernando,
where the children are gathered together
Sunday by Sunday.</p>

<p>The difference between these Argentine
children and ourselves is just this, that everything
here in Britain is done to help the
children, and to surround them with a pure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
atmosphere and holy influences. Out there
it is not so; everything is against the children
growing up to be even morally good men and
women.</p>

<p>They are so familiar with sin that their
sense of sin is destroyed, and they are therefore
harder to reach than pure pagans. If
ever a city needed a &#8220;Blossom Home,&#8221; it is
Buenos Aires, where we find children of all
nations.</p>

<p>One of the finest institutions for children
and young people in the whole of this continent
is, however, to be seen here at the present
day. We cannot leave Argentina without
paying a visit to the suburb of Palermo,
where are situated the schools superintended
by the Rev. William Case Morris, the &#8220;Dr
Barnardo of South America.&#8221;</p>

<p>While in business, in the Boca district of
the city, some years ago, Mr Morris saw the
poverty and ignorance of the children about
him, and he longed to see something done for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
them. Of his own accord, and with his own
private funds, he commenced a school for
poor children. Upon this he spent years of
labour and much money, seeking to better
the lot of his juvenile friends.</p>

<p>With the South American Missionary Society
at his back, he established day-schools, Sunday-schools,
and schools of industry, through
which hundreds of Spanish-speaking children
have passed since their foundation.</p>

<p>Who are the scholars? With the exception
of a very small number we find they are children
of the poorest class. Many are children
of invalid parents, others of widowed mothers.
In the case of several, the father is serving
a long term of imprisonment for crime. Some
are almost alone in the world; many are quite
alone&mdash;&#8220;nobody&#8217;s children,&#8221; waifs, to whom
life is a dreary, desolate solitude.</p>

<p>Numbers of the children had been surrounded
by an atmosphere of ignorance and
sin, and would a few years later have been a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
cause of trouble to the police, had it not been
for such an institution as this. It is not only
a training place for the mind, but a school
for character, where the children&#8217;s souls are
lifted out of the mire and trained in the atmosphere
of heaven.</p>

<p>What sweetening influences must now be
at work, where every youth and maiden is
who has passed through this school! Think
of the five thousand who are being trained to
be witnesses for Christ to their own people in
this continent, where we see still so much
darkness, degradation, and superstition.</p>

<p>The whole secret of successful work amongst
Spanish-speaking children is splendidly summed
up by Mrs Strachan, an E.U.S.A. missionary
in Tandil. She says:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our work in the Sunday-school makes us
feel more than ever the pressing and immediate
need of day-schools. It seems impossible in
one short hour to make an impression on the
children.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>&#8220;How can you teach a child that a lie is a
lie, when lies are told at home and in day-school?
How can you make him understand
that to steal is a sin when everybody else tells
him that the only sin about it is to be found
out?</p>

<p>&#8220;The child of South America is up against
all that sort of thing; it is the very air he
breathes during the week.</p>

<p>&#8220;He comes to us for an hour on Sunday;
how much do you think can be done to press
home these powerful influences? We are
more than ever convinced that if we are to
do in this country a work that will take deep
root downward, and bear fruit upward, the
children must be got hold of, placed in the
right atmosphere, and taught on the right
lines. For this we must get the day-schools
and get them quickly.&#8221;</p>

<small>DIMINUTIVE DWELLERS IN THE LAND OF FIRE</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">More</span> than one hundred years ago God sent
a baby boy to Mr and Mrs Gardiner. They
called him Allen Francis. He had four elder
brothers, and as the lads romped and played
games and learned lessons together, they would
have been ever so much surprised if they could
have taken a peep into the future, and seen
what wonderful adventures in strange lands,
among strange people, and what terrible dangers
and difficulties were in store for little Allen.</p>

<p>&#8220;He always said he &#8216;meant to be a sailor,
and travel all over the world,&#8217; and one night
when Mrs Gardiner went to tuck him up and
give him a good-night kiss, she found his bed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
empty, and her little boy fast asleep on the
hard floor&mdash;&#8216;getting hardened and used to
roughing it,&#8217; he told her. When thirteen years
old he went to the Naval College at Portsmouth
for two years, and then his life as a sailor began.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who will come in thought with me and pay
a visit to the Land of Fire? Before we
start, let us remember that first we take a long
leap into the past&mdash;we jump backwards over
fifty years&mdash;for we want to join our dear old
friend and sailor Captain Allen Gardiner.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall certainly all need our strongest
boots and thickest wraps and waterproofs,
as we join our sailor hero. Sleet and hail are
beating around the boat on all sides, and every
few minutes a wave dashes across the bows.
When we land on one of the Islands, and trudge
along by the Captain&#8217;s side, on one of his exploring
expeditions, we find the mud more than
knee-deep in many places.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall find the natives a very miserable
lot of people. They have no form of worship,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
no idols; they know nothing whatever of
God. There is not even a word in their language
to express the name of God. They are Indians,
and divided into many different tribes, all at
enmity with each other; always quarrelling
and at war. Food is often the cause of the
trouble, for it is very hard to get.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are Canoe Indians and Foot Indians.
The Canoe Indians live almost entirely upon
fish and fungus, and the Foot Indians on birds
and animals killed by bows and arrows and
spears made of whalebone. Nowhere do we
see the smallest sign of the land being tilled or
cultivated; indeed, corn would not ripen in
the Land of Fire, for the climate is very damp
and windy. Even in summer the sun rarely
shines, only wind and rain then take the place
of the winter storms of sleet and snow.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is plenty of good water on the Islands,
so, as our supply on board the <i>Clymene</i> is running
short, we will draw into one of the harbours
and refill the water-casks before we pursue our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
journey to Banner Cove, where the Captain
thinks of putting up the wooden storehouse he
has brought from England, and landing our
goods.</p>

<p>&#8220;Before the <i>Clymene</i> sails away, while our
companions are busy fixing up a tent, we spy
several canoes of Indians coming towards us.
In a moment our friend has his telescope pointed
in their direction, eager to find out all about
them. We soon see they are afraid; it is the
glass that frightens them. They think it some
dangerous weapon! So it is quickly laid aside
and we make signs of friendship.</p>

<p>&#8220;Many of the men come on board after a time,
and gladly take the buttons we offer in exchange
for fish and shell necklaces. They are queer-looking,
dark brown people, with large heads,
small, sharp, black eyes, and long, jet-black
hair hanging straight down over each shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;A little girl, about three years old, ventures
near the Captain, and very great is the delight
of all when she returns to her mother with a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
bright-coloured cotton handkerchief round her
shoulders. They are much interested in us,
and the keen, black eyes watch intently every
movement, while the water-casks are brought
from the shore, and taken from the small boat
to the larger vessel.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder how many of us keep a diary!
There is one diary I know all of us, yes every
boy and girl and grown-up reader of this book,
would very much like to see. How tenderly
we should turn over those storm-stained pages!
How lovingly we should gaze at the clear
pencil hand-writing of this wonderful diary!</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps if we really did see and read it, some
of us would be inspired with feelings akin to
those of a little girl of nine years old who went
home from a missionary meeting and wrote:&mdash;&#8216;Mark
xvi. 15 says: &#8220;Go ye into all the world,
and preach the Gospel to every creature.&#8221;
This is a commandment of my Saviour, to be
obeyed by me as soon as I am old enough.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;More than fifty years ago, Captain Smyley,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
in command of the <i>John Davidson</i>, sailed into
Banner Cove. He was searching for a party
of seven missionaries to whom he had been sent
with food and stores. He found no Englishmen
or native of the Land of Fire upon the seashore,
but painted on a rock he saw a notice: &#8216;Dig
below.&#8217; The crew landed, and obeying the
first two words, they dug up a bottle containing
a paper, on which was written: &#8216;We are
gone to Spaniard&#8217;s Harbour.... We have
sickness on board: our supplies are nearly
out, and if not soon relieved we shall be starved
out.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>With many misgivings they hastened to
Spaniard&#8217;s Harbour. It was then October, so
seven months had passed since the notice had
been painted on the rocks. The first vessel
sent to the help of the brave missionaries had
been wrecked. How had they fared during
those months of waiting? Had the help come
too late?</p>

<p>Yes, already that faithful band&mdash;our hero<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
Captain Allen Gardiner, and his six comrades&mdash;have
all passed into the Happy Land where
&#8220;they shall hunger no more, neither thirst any
more.&#8221; Sorrowful indeed was the sight that
awaited the searchers. A boat on the beach
with a lifeless body within; another lying
not far off, washed to pieces by the waves;
another buried in a shallow grave upon the
shore: all seven starved to death.</p>

<p>What was the effect of this martyrdom?
Was it thought worth while for others to risk
their lives for the Fuegian Indians? The Rev.
G. P. Despard and his wife, when they heard
of the facts, said: &#8220;With God&#8217;s help, this
good work shall go on.&#8221; And in a beautiful
new schooner called the <i>Allen Gardiner</i>, another
mission party started for that distant land.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_080.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">DUSKY DARLINGS</p>

<p>&#8220;It was decided to make Keppel Island, which
is one of the Falkland group, their headquarters.
With much labour a house was built, and a
little mission-station and farm formed there.
The intention was to try and get two or three<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
of the Fuegian natives to come and live with
them at Keppel, hoping to be able to learn the
language from these natives, whilst they taught
them all the good and useful things they
could.</p>

<p>&#8220;Many years before, a native, who was known
by the name of Jimmy Button, had been brought
to England by Captain Fitzroy. When Jimmy
went back to his own country he was quite
lost sight of by his English friends. However,
he was met with one day in his canoe by the
party from Keppel, and they found that he
still remembered much of the English he had
learned. After being kindly treated by the
missionaries, and enjoying some of their coffee
and bread and butter, he said he was quite
willing to go with his wife and three children
to stay with them for six months.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jimmy Button and his family soon became
quite at home upon the mission farm. One
of Jimmy&#8217;s boys, a bright, sharp, little lad
of about eight years, whom his father called<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
&#8216;Threeboys,&#8217; very quickly picked up many
English words; but they were all so shy about
speaking their own language before foreigners
that they talked to each other in whispers,
which of course made it very difficult for the
missionaries to learn anything about the Fuegian
language. When the six months were up Mr
Despard took all the Button family back to
Woollya on the <i>Allen Gardiner</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Little by little grew the work amongst the
Fuegian Indians, and especially amongst the
children, many of whom are orphans, now under
the missionaries&#8217; care.</p>

<p>There was one dear little Fuegian girl whom
the missionaries named Jessica&mdash;bright, loveable,
quick, and good both at lessons and work.
She, with others, was taught many things, chief
of which was the Bible.</p>

<p>One day Jessica was nowhere to be seen.
Morning passed away, afternoon came, and
then followed the evening, but still Jessica
had not come back. Weeks went by, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
feeling sure she had been stolen, they ceased
to look out for her.</p>

<p>In the middle of lessons one morning, a
pair of arms was flung suddenly round the
missionary&#8217;s neck, and someone was showering
her with kisses. It was Jessica.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where have you been? Why did you run
away from school?&#8221; asked the lady looking
displeased at Jessica.</p>

<p>Her eyes brimmed over with tears as she
answered: &#8220;I went to fetch you a present.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A present!&#8221; echoed the teacher.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; said Jessica, taking her hand, and
leading her to a wood close by. &#8220;There is the
present I have brought you,&#8221; said Jessica; and
looking she saw eleven little naked, half-starved
children, all bunched together, and looking
terrified at the white person.</p>

<p>Having heard the Good News for herself,
she loved the Lord Jesus so much that she just
longed for other children to hear of Him too.
She had journeyed for miles over rough woods<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
with her bare feet, over dangerous paths, and
through streams of water, in order to bring
others to the Saviour. What a dear little
brown missionary she was! For she is now in
the presence of the Lord.</p>

<p>Another little Indian orphan, named Elsie,
was being cared for by the Rev. J. and Mrs
Williams. Her father had died about seven
years previously, and her mother also passed
away soon afterwards. Mrs Williams took
special charge of this bright little girl, but one
day several of Elsie&#8217;s Indian friends went off
on a hunting tour, and took her with them.</p>

<p>Some time afterwards they returned, but
without Elsie. What had become of her?
Was she lost or dead? Alas, no. Perhaps it
would have been far better if she were. &#8220;What
have you done with Elsie?&#8221; And the reply
was that the Indians had sold her to a Spaniard!</p>

<p>What was the price he paid for Elsie? Why,
just a bag of flour, and a bottle of gin! Months
have passed, and still no Elsie. It is feared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
that she cannot return if she would. Away
from her tribe and from all who love her; sold
to a Spaniard who cares not for her; this poor
little jewel is living, redeemed with the precious
blood of Christ, the slave of a white man, but
the child of the living God.</p>

<p>Pray for such, and determine, like the little
girl who went to the missionary meeting, that
your Saviour&#8217;s command to &#8220;go into all the
world&#8221; shall be obeyed by you as soon as you
are old enough.</p>

<small>CHILIAN CHILDREN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> you look at a map of South America you
will find a long, narrow strip of country running
north and south alongside of Argentina. Some
funny person has described this Republic of
Chili as being 2000 miles long and two inches
wide! Long and narrow though it is, nevertheless
it is very rich in nitrates, so useful
for cleansing and enriching the soil. Gold,
petroleum, and coal are also to be found there.</p>

<p>Chili is very much like her sister Republics,
both morally and spiritually, and especially as
regards dirt and disease. Smallpox is rampant
both in Santiago and Valparaiso, and people
suffering from this dreadful disease are actually
to be seen walking about the streets.</p>

<p>The &#8220;conventillos,&#8221; which are here only one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
storey high, are killing grounds for children.
Eight out of ten children die under two years
of age. Dr Speer says: &#8220;Alcoholism, dirt,
and uncleanness of the houses, and murderous
ignorance of the care of children&#8221; are at the
bottom of this exceedingly high death-rate
in Chili. So much for Chilians.</p>

<p>Now a word as to the Araucanian Indians
in the interior of that Republic. They are
semi-civilized, and a very superior tribe of
people. Though nominally under the Government
of Chili, they are actually independent of
it, and are governed by their own laws. The
Araucanians are quite different in appearance,
manners, and habits from other Indians. As
far as cleanliness goes, they are far in advance
of the Chilians themselves.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are quite as proud, and as resentful
of dishonour as the Red Man of the North, and
quite as brave in disposition; and, like the Red
Indians, they are open, free and generous, and
form strong attachments to those who gain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
their confidence, with equally strong hatred
towards those who do them wrong. They
have coarse, black hair, and large widespread
noses.</p>

<p>&#8220;The women are among the best looking in
the entire country. They do not marry at so
early an age as the other Indians, and they do
not seem to be ever ill-treated by their husbands.
They are fond of their children and
respectful to old age.</p>

<p>&#8220;The religion of these people is much like
that of the Red Indians. They acknowledge
a &#8216;Spirit&#8217; who is the Author of, and Master
over all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Take your pen and underline three places
on the map, viz.: &#8220;Temuco, Cholcol, Quepe.&#8221;
There the Mapuche Indians live, and amongst
them labour the missionaries of the South
American Missionary Society.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mapuche&#8221; means, &#8220;people of the land,&#8221;
and a successful, spiritual work is being carried
on especially amongst the children. There are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
schools for boys and girls at Quepe, also at
Temuco, ten miles away; and at Cholcol, a
small Chilian town twenty-one miles from
Temuco, there are boarding-schools for boys
and girls, day-schools, a dispensary, and a
church.</p>

<p>Rev. G. Daunt says: &#8220;In the old days they
were all clever hunters. They could glide
through the forest without making a sound,
and could imitate exactly the cries of various
birds and beasts. They showed great skill
in following up a &#8216;trail,&#8217; and could observe
the slightest movement of leaf or twig in the
pursuit of prey or of an enemy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, the Mapuche are losing their hunting
habits, and are settling down to a peaceable
and industrious life, growing corn, and feeding
cattle. But in their games they still act as if
scenting and following up a trail.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Indian boys and girls have to work
as well. In the summer, when the crops are
ripening, the children are seen in the fields<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
guarding the sheep, cattle, horses, and pigs, so
that these may not enter and destroy the
harvest.</p>

<p>&#8220;The girls draw water from the wells and
streams, and help their mothers to make and
mend the clothes they wear. The boys, with
their axes, form ploughs, and carts, and with
their knives carve toys of wood or cut belts
and purses from the skins of animals into
strange shapes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Wetherell gives a very interesting pen-picture
of school-life with the Mapuche boys
and girls at Quepe:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;The body of one of our schoolboys was
committed to the grave. Poor laddie, he came
into the hospital about two years ago with a
diseased leg, which the doctor had to remove.
His people, finding that he would be unable
to help in the farm work, promptly deserted
him, so he was kept on at the hospital, and
during school time he was out here. He got
on very well with his lessons, but he never got<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
really strong, and eventually he had to return
to the hospital, where he died. The following
morning we all went across to the little Mapuche
Cemetery, and buried him there. It must
have seemed very strange to these Mapuche
boys and girls, this quiet Christian burial&mdash;the
simple service, the flowers strewn on the
grave, and the hymn sung as the soil was being
shovelled in.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have one Chilian boarder, a very nice
gentle lad, whom we all like very much, and
we hope he will one day be a true Christian. He
saved the life of an Englishman in Argentina
under quite romantic circumstances; and his
master, who is in England, wished to leave him
where he could be educated and treated kindly&mdash;so
he is here. At present his thoughts are
chiefly occupied with football and his lessons,
football of course first.</p>

<p>&#8220;One small mite announced to-day that she
was going to &#8216;stay with the Se&ntilde;ora all the
holidays.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>&#8220;&#8216;But,&#8217; said I, &#8216;you would not like to stay
here and not go home at all?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Oh, yes, I should,&#8217; promptly answered
little Fatty; &#8216;school is <i>much</i> nicer than being
at home.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I imagine the little ones do sometimes find
this the case, as they do quite a lot of work
in their homes. I remember one day teaching
in my Scripture class something about a
mother&#8217;s love, and I asked the children: &#8216;Now
on cold, frosty mornings, when you are all
cosily tucked up in bed, who gets up to light
the fire and get the breakfast?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I expected them to say in a chorus:
&#8216;My mother&#8217;; but instead of that the answer
came: &#8216;Why, my little brother, of course.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Last night, while most of the big ones
were out at evening service, the little ones and
I had great times hymn-singing. Two or
three quite wee mites will sing alone, and it is
wonderful how well they sing and how many
hymns they know by heart. The brother of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
one small person was telling the native teacher
that last holidays he built a new house for
himself, and invited all his relations to the
house-warming, and when the meal was over
he said: &#8216;Now someone should sing a song.
Who will sing for me?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Fancy&#8217; added he, &#8216;my surprise when my
little sister, who did not know a word of
Spanish a few months ago, stood up before us
and sang most sweetly and correctly a hymn
that she had learned at school!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sometimes our little Mapuche friends fall
sick, and then the small patients are taken
to Temuco, placed in the mission-hospital,
and nursed and tended by Dr Baynes and his
splendid family.</p>

<p>&#8220;At evening time, when the light begins to
fail, the missionary turns his horse homewards,
and as he rides rapidly over the plain, here and
there the words of the vesper hymn sung by
some Indian boy or girl are wafted to him on
the evening air:&mdash;</p>

<p>There are &#8220;other lambs&#8221; in Chili who have
yet to be sought out and brought in. Some
day you may be helping Christ to seek and
find them. In the meantime give the Mapuche
children a place in your prayers, and tell others

<small>BOLIVIAN BAIRNS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Bolivia</span>, the Hermit Republic of South America,
is hidden away behind the mighty Andes. It
is the fourth country in the continent in point
of size, and a vast treasure house of silver and
tin.</p>

<p>More than half the inhabitants are pure-blooded
Indians, degenerate descendants of
the valiant Inca race.</p>

<p>The most interesting and useful animal to
the Indian is the llama. He will travel for
miles without food or drink, over precipitous
mountains and rocky paths, carry his 100-lb.
load, and not an ounce more; for if you should
happen to impose upon him he simply lies
down on the path and refuses to budge an inch.
They are splendid &#8220;passive resisters,&#8221; these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
llamas, and will have no nonsense from anyone,
though, of course, their Indian owners know
better than to overburden their llamas with
superfluous luggage.</p>

<p>The llama, known as &#8220;the Bolivian
Railway,&#8221; can travel fifteen miles a day.
When he dies his flesh is eaten, but the Indian
loves his animal too well to kill him for food.</p>

<p>&#8220;In many places the Indians are ill-treated,
deceived, and robbed by the white Spanish-speaking
people. They are looked upon as
mere brutes, fit for nothing but work, instead
of human beings with immortal souls. They
sometimes live together in villages, sometimes
in isolated, quiet nooks, or it may be in
clusters of huts where there are two or three
families.&#8221;</p>

<p>Each Indian has a few patches of ground for
himself, and in exchange for this cultivates a
few acres of crops for his owner. He also has
a certain number of animals to care for, but
this is mostly the work of his wife and family.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
Little children of from four to five years of age
are supposed to be capable of driving a flock,
and when a few years older they are away on
the hills all day alone with their flocks.</p>

<p>One scarcely sees an Indian, either man or
woman, altogether idle. If they have no other
occupation, they spin away at wool for the
clothing of their families.</p>

<p>Though this is an open and very healthy
climate there is much sickness among the
people, chiefly because they do not know how
to take care of themselves. It is very amusing
to see what remedies they use for inward
and outward complaints. Dirt, feathers, and
anything horrible is the common ointment for
sores or wounds. At a little ordinary warm
water they laugh. Through the ignorance of
their mothers, children, when sick, have a hard
time. Some care very much, and would do
anything to save their children; but others,
rather than have the trouble of watching them,
prefer that they should die, as a good many do.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>&#8220;It is the condition of the little children
that calls forth most sympathy and pity, and
makes us long for the day when the True Light
shall shine into the hearts of the people. The
majority, unloved and uncared for, surrounded
by dirt and disease, know nothing of the
joys of childhood, nor of the blessing of home
life.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mothers are continually seen carrying their
babies, full of disease, about the streets, and,
what is worse, sitting in the market-places
selling meat and bread with their sick babies
in their laps. Passing along one day, a child
was seen without a shred of clothing, yet with
its little body literally covered with smallpox.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr Will Payne, a pioneer missionary of
Bolivia, says it is quite a common thing to
buy and sell children in this country. He
tells of three little girls who were purchased for
&pound;2 each, &#8220;and are held by their owner until
they reach the age of twenty-one, during which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
time they are compelled to work in the house,
receiving their food and clothing in exchange.</p>

<p>&#8220;If they fall into the hands of a kind master
or mistress they have an easy, happy time,
and in a few cases are taught to read and write.
Should they, however, find a cruel owner,
there is nothing to prevent their suffering very
much like the slaves of other days.</p>

<p>&#8220;These children are sold by their parents
when young, and sometimes never know their
father or mother. How often has blood been
seen flowing from the head of one of these girls,
the result of a cruel blow with a strap, because
she did not move quickly enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>A very sad story is told by one of the missionaries
of the Bolivian Indian Mission, of a little
Indian boy. &#8220;His left forearm, and half of
left leg, are one mass of partially-healed ulcers.
He tells us how, over a year ago, he was caught
and deliberately thrown into the fire. His
father had sold him to a neighbour, and one
day, whilst shepherding, he allowed some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
goats to fall over a cliff: then his owner, in a
fit of rage committed this inhuman act.</p>

<p>&#8220;After a year of intense suffering, he was
brought by his apathetic father for treatment.
But perhaps we ought not to blame the father
too much, as he is totally blind. However, the
man who burned the boy was compelled to
pay the father a sum of 28s., and to release the
boy. After this the boy&#8217;s father sold him
again, but the boy escaped, and is now under
treatment.&#8221;</p>

<p>Such incidents happen daily, showing how
inhuman and ignorant the majority of the
Indians are. The Roman Catholic religion
has not converted their hearts, the only
change that has taken place has been that of
the religion and the idols. The hearts and
lives that were dark before, without the knowledge
of Christ, have been plunged into deeper
gloom through the blighting influence of the
Roman priesthood.</p>

<p>Some of the Romish masses celebrated by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
the people are called the &#8220;Little Masses for the
Child Jesus.&#8221; These take place from Christmas
to the time of Carnival. Everybody who has
an image of Christ as a child is supposed to
provide a feast during this time. A band of
music is procured, and the little image is decked
out with pearls and gay flowers, and carried
to the Roman Catholic church, in front of a
crowd of neighbours. A mass is said, and then
the figure is taken home amid great rejoicing.
Drinking, feasting, and dancing follow, and are
kept up until a late hour.</p>

<p>On January 31st and February 1st the
people prepare for Candlemas, which takes
place on the 2nd. They are taught by the
priest that on this day the children who have
died without baptism can get a little light. It
is the feast of the mothers, and the priests tell
the people how necessary it is to come to church
with their candles.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not be like so many pieces of stick;
come and bring your candles, and think of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
your poor dead children awaiting your candles
to get some light!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So the next day the poor mothers come
with their candles of all sorts and sizes. Long
candles, short candles, thin candles, thick
candles. What a mine of wealth for the
priests the sale of this holy (!) grease must be!</p>

<p>&#8220;May God light the candle of each life in
order that some day someone who reads this
may be able to show the Bolivian Bairns the
way to Heaven. Only the light that Christ
gives is of any service to Him, and to those
who &#8216;sit in darkness and in the shadow of
death.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The Bolivian Indians do not have many
children, as the poor mites, through neglect
and ill-treatment, die in hundreds every year,
most of them under two years of age.</p>

<p>Another reason why Indians have such small
families is that when the children grow up to
be twelve or thirteen years of age they marry
and have homes of their own.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>Mr and Mrs Will Payne did some splendid
pioneer work amongst these people before the
liberty of preaching the Gospel was proclaimed
in the Republic. They suffered much persecution
at the hands of the Roman Catholics,
but now missionary work can go forward without
hindrance, and to-day the South American
Missionary Society is at work in Southern
Bolivia, while the Bolivian Indian Mission is
ministering to the Quechua-speaking remnant
of the bygone Inca race.</p>

<p>In writing of the children, one of the missionaries
in San Pedro says of the school work:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;The school is open to all, and boys and
girls of the white and half-caste classes attend.
(The Indians do not live in the town.) The
school opens every morning with the singing
of a hymn, a Scripture lesson and prayer,
in all of which great interest is taken. Mother
earth constitutes the floor. The walls are of
mud, and the ceiling is of a rough thatching
of rushes. For years the room served as a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
cook-house, and knew neither chimney nor
window, nor any other means of exit for the
smoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nowadays two large holes in the wall, one
shuttered, the other not, admit light which
reveals a blackness that water cannot cleanse.
Two or three geography maps gravely endeavour
to hide the sooty walls, and, aided by
three mud seats that traverse the room, humbly
announce that this is Ch&#8217;iquipampa School-house.&#8221;</p>

<p>Outside, mounted upon a pole which stands
in the centre of the &#8220;estancia&#8221; courtyard, is
the school bell. For nearly a century it hung
in the belfry of a Roman Catholic chapel away
out among the Bolivian mountains. But it, too,
has felt the impulse of modernism, and now
follows a reformed calling.</p>

<p>The sun is the only time-keeper known in
the &#8220;campo.&#8221; The only definite hours are
those of his rising and setting; therefore the
bell sounds the assemble at sunrise, and soon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
two or three groups of children, enveloped
in gay-coloured and picturesque ponchos, are
seen leisurely sauntering to obey the summons&mdash;perhaps.
In they come at the open door,
doffing their &#8220;sombreros&#8221; (hats) respectfully
enough, with a &#8220;Buenos dias, Se&ntilde;or!&#8221; (&#8220;Good
day, Sir&#8221;).</p>

<p>Now we have before us seven or eight black
heads, whose owners range in age from five to
fifteen years. There are really as many grades
as there are individuals.</p>

<p>Modestly, seated farthest back is Haquin,
a bright Indian lad. He came to school
early, and has already been a full half-hour
hard at his reading-book, for he must soon
leave in order to take his father&#8217;s cattle afield
to pasture. Three months ago, he did not
know a single letter. Now he reads and
writes fairly large words.</p>

<p>Now slates, books, and pencils are served
out, and for three long hours our young
Bolivians are under restraint. Lazy little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
Antonio raises his slate high in air with both
hands and yawns audibly. A tap on the big,
black head, and a quiet word, recall him to
his task. During a full half-hour he has
written only one word, but Government forbids
the rod.</p>

<p>The time has arrived for reading-lessons,
and a whisper of appreciation is heard, for
reading from the &#8220;Spanish Reader&#8221; involves
a lesson in Spanish; and Indian and &#8220;Cholo&#8221;
(half-caste) alike learn eagerly and quickly
the tongue of the ruling class. Confronted
by Bolivia&#8217;s map, a barely suppressed giggle
ripples through the school. They think the
names of towns, rivers, and mountains are
so foreign and funny!</p>

<p>Arithmetic is useful, however, and all work
diligently at this. Little Manuel is the pride
and joy of the school in this department.
Three months previously he could not write
a single figure. Now, he adds and subtracts
and multiplies with great exactness.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>Now, at the words, &#8220;Slates down,&#8221; these
articles reach the hard floor with a rattle.
Little Nieva draws her naked feet up on to
the seat, and arranges her &#8220;manta&#8221; with
the air of a Turkish princess. Word goes
round, &#8220;The Jesus Book&#8221;; and a respectful
silence prevails. Thank God, for these
wonderful stories of the Saviour. The children&#8217;s
verdict is: &#8220;Beautiful.&#8221; Thanks to Him
for at least this small portion of the Gospel
of St John translated into Quechua.</p>

<p>Now comes time for dismissal&mdash;with a
respectful &#8220;Hasta ma&ntilde;ana, Se&ntilde;or!&#8221; (&#8220;Until
to-morrow, Sir!&#8221;), or the Quechua &#8220;Ce&#8217;aya
cama,&#8221; they file out, soon to break forth
into whistle and shout, just like the little
folks in the homeland.</p>

<p>Our head is somewhat muddled with this
two-language task of teaching Quechua-speaking
children from Spanish text-books.
Some attend for a week or two, and then come
no more. The parents desire that they should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
be educated, but confess to being powerless
to persuade the young folks to attend.</p>

<p>Mr Grocott, of the Bolivian Indian Mission,
having given such an interesting account of the
day-school work, Mrs Grocott now tells about
the Sunday-school. She says:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Could you visit our little school-room
some Sunday morning, between seven and
eight o&#8217;clock, you would find a little gathering
of from twelve to twenty-five men, women,
and children, representing the whites, the
half-castes, and the pure Indians. These are
gathered to learn about Jesus. They do not
come because it is God&#8217;s Day, for Sunday to
them is as other days. No, they come because
they like to come.</p>

<p>&#8220;They have dirty faces, uncombed hair,
and clothing which has not been washed for
many weeks. Not an attractive audience, is
it? But a missionary may not be critical.
She has come to teach them to do better, and
one must always begin at the beginning.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>&#8220;The day-school children come to these
meetings, as do some of the parents. The
Indians are rather shy at entering, and often
prefer listening at the window. Those who
do come in look round for an out-of-the-way
corner, and, despising a seat, squat on the floor.
One day a young Indian came in and immediately
knelt down bareheaded before the blackboard,
in an attitude of prayer.</p>

<p>&#8220;At the time of his entering, the attention
of those present was centred upon the
words written on the blackboard and he
evidently thought of worship. Being accustomed
to kneel in the Roman Catholic
church before shrines and images, he was
quite prepared to kneel to anything that
appeared to him to be the object of worship
for the day.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very few Indians can sing, but some
of the half-castes do fairly well. Several
hymns have already been translated into
Quechua.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>Christ&#8217;s command to &#8220;heal the sick,&#8221; as
well as to &#8220;teach&#8221; and &#8220;preach the Gospel,&#8221;
is being faithfully carried out as far as possible
by the missionaries to these benighted people.
The healing of the body opens the door to the
healing of the soul.</p>

<p>A Spanish doctor will not touch an Indian;
and for this great work of healing, the power
of God is needed.</p>

<p>There are very many villages in this hermit
republic without a missionary of any kind
whatever. Come with me, and see for yourselves.
Here on a mud bed in a corner
sits a poor woman amidst her rags. A wound
which she has had a long, long time has
reduced her to a skeleton. Beside her is
a sickly-looking baby. Between her sobs
she tells us she has neither a home nor a
husband.</p>

<p>The tiny room, which serves as a living-room,
bedroom, and cobbler&#8217;s shop, is full from
floor to ceiling. The floor is covered with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
cooking-pots, ten altogether, &#8220;stones for
grinding corn into meal, great earthenware
pots for making chicha (the native drink), old
boots, piles of potatoes and maize, bones,
rags, and dirt&mdash;plenty of dirt. From under
the bed run guinea-pigs, whilst keeping the
woman company in bed are a dog and a
pigeon!</p>

<p>&#8220;Amidst old tins and bottles on the
shelves we see San Antonio and the Virgin.
On the wall hangs a picture of what looks
something like a woman, the Virgin. A
rope full of clothes stretches across the
room, and a few other odds and ends leave
but little space, which is filled up with
smell.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is what the missionary has to contend
with, and as we emerge into the sunshine,
and breathe God&#8217;s air once more, we long to
see a large, airy building where the sick ones
can be tended and nursed back to health.
Shall we not begin to pray: &#8220;Lord send out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
some of Thy messengers, and some day, if it
is Thy will, I will go and help them.&#8221;</p>

<small>PEARLS OF PERU</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Last</span>, but not least, we come to the most
historical and romantic Republic of the whole
continent, Peru. This country was discovered
by an adventurer named Pizarro. He was a
zealous Roman Catholic, but his spirit of
greediness over-balanced his religion, and the
story of his conquest of the Inca Indians of
Peru, as related by Prescott, is one of the
darkest in history.</p>

<p>Before the invasion of Pizarro and his fellow-countrymen,
over four hundred years ago,
there lived a very highly-civilized race of
Indians who called themselves the &#8220;Children
of the Sun.&#8221; They were a most enlightened
and industrious people, having their own king,
as well as their own laws and religion.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>Since the days of Pizarro and his followers
everything has changed. The king was slain
with hundreds of his loyal subjects, and
the Spaniards took possession of the land.
There you will see the Indians to-day,
living in spiritual darkness and superstition,
scarcely able to call their souls their own, a
crushed and conquered remnant of a once
splendid race; and to-day &#8220;the children&#8217;s
souls which God is calling sunward, spin on
blindly in the dark.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the lonely mountain side we will find
them, tiny mites of three and four years of age,
tending the sheep, and often very scantily
protected from the severe and biting winds.
But the mountain children have an easy time
of it compared to the children of the city, for
slavery and starvation are the common lot of
these little ones.</p>

<p>We will visit Cuzco, the romantic and
religious city of the Inca race; but we must
not forget to sprinkle our handkerchiefs with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
perfume, for we have now got back to the
hot climate, and the streets we are walking
through are long and narrow and have an open
drain running down the centre, a common
thing in these cities. But if we would be
missionaries some day, we must not mind the
smells now, especially as we want to become
acquainted with some of the &#8220;Pearls of Peru.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a minute or two we pause and watch
the children, who seem to swarm everywhere.
Some are playing at the nasty drain; no
wonder these little ones droop and die, for there
is no friendly policeman to warn them that
this is a death trap!</p>

<p>Where do they all come from? Does no
one look after them? For they are everywhere,
in the road, on doorsteps, in the shops,
round the booths in the market-place, under
the shadow of the Roman Catholic Cathedral;
scores of them, playing, sleeping, picking up
scraps and eating them, uncared for, and
untaught.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>See! Who is this coming down the cobbly
street, with a big, fat baby on his back? Only
an Indian boy, and not very much bigger than
his baby mistress. What a sad face he has;
it does not attract us, for there is a shade of
bitterness about the mouth. His is a hard
life&mdash;driven to and fro by the whim of the
baby&#8217;s mother; no thanks and no pay; only
beatings if he does not please her. An Indian
slave! You look surprised! But this is quite
a common thing in Peru and other parts of this
continent.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_116.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">INDIAN SLAVE AND HIS BABY MISTRESS</p>

<p>In her fascinating book on &#8220;Peru,&#8221; Miss
Geraldine Guinness says: &#8220;In Arequipa
there are three thousand of these little Indian
slaves, four-fifths of whom are cruelly treated,
while the good treatment of the remaining
one-fifth, with rare exceptions, consists in the
fact of their not being brutally beaten, and not
suffering much hunger.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have heard the screams of child-servants
not more than seven years old, who were daily
beaten by a bad-tempered mistress. I have
seen children ill and dying, for whom no one
cared. I know a little girl of seven, who, a
few months ago, saw her mother&#8217;s dead body
taken away to the cemetery. Since that day
she has minded the shop all alone, and kept
house for her father, who only comes home at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
nights, and who is often away for weeks at a
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Some years ago, when the maize crop failed,
and there was a terrible famine in the land,
starvation stared the Indian mothers in the
face. What were they to do under such circumstances?
They could not feed their little
ones, so the children were brought to the cities
in thousands, and sold for a few shillings or
given away, to save the mothers and other
little ones in the mountain huts from starvation
and death. To-day it is not an uncommon
thing to be accosted in the street by an Indian
woman, and to be asked to purchase her little
girl or boy for a few coins.</p>

<p>The only British Missionary Society working
in this vast republic of Peru is the Evangelical
Union of South America. Try and realize it;
a country half the size of China, and only a
handful of missionaries to proclaim the Gospel
to these people. Take your pen and underline
&#8220;Lima, Cuzco, Huanuco, Arequipa, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
Urco&#8221; (twenty-four miles out of Cuzco), and
you have the only centres of British missionary
enterprise at the present time. Let us visit
these mission-stations and see for ourselves
what is being done for the children.</p>

<p>Of all the cities in Peru, Lima is the most
cosmopolitan. Visiting one part of the town
on the outskirts one might almost fancy we
were in China; at another spot everything is
entirely negro, and some other part appears
to be under Turkish supervision. Here we
jostle against Peruvian priests, who do not
attract us, American, English, and Italian
merchants, and people from almost every land
under the sun. What a medley!</p>

<p>&#8220;The houses in Lima have no chimneys,
they are one storey high, and what windows
there are facing into the street are barred,
making the houses look like prisons. The
poorer parts of Lima consist largely of
&#8216;conventillos&#8217; similar to these in Argentina.
They are often large, sunny, open courtyards,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
and sometimes narrow alleys, always
entered by doors in the walls of the
main streets, and surrounded by cell-like
rooms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Every aspect of life may be seen in the
central yard. There the dinner is cooked,
the baby bathed, the clothes washed, and the
Virgin worshipped. At every step one comes
upon a child, and all appear equally contented
and uncared for.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lima is in the centre of a region, not only
free from rain, but where earthquakes frequently
occur, so that mud, cane, and plaster are used
for house-building purposes instead of stone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Although it never rains in Lima, yet during
the dry season, Peru&#8217;s winter&mdash;June to
September&mdash;the capital is enveloped in mist,
which is exceedingly disagreeable. For days
and weeks the sun is invisible, and a drizzle,
not unlike a Scotch mist, makes the side-walks
slippery, and so permeates the air that the
sheets on one&#8217;s bed are chill and sticky.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>Lima is the city where the Society&#8217;s printing-press
is at work. Month by month, the little
silent messenger of the Gospel, <i>El Heraldo</i>, is
sent forth by post throughout Peru; and as
postage is quite free, you will see that every
postman is thus a &#8220;colporteur.&#8221; Many other
things besides are printed, but <i>El Heraldo</i>
is the foremost message proclaiming &#8220;pardon,
peace, and power to hundreds whom the voice
of the preacher cannot reach.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more we find ourselves in Cuzco.
Here several ladies of the E.U.S.A. are to
be seen at work. Miss Elder, Miss Pinn,
Miss Found, and Miss Trumper, are doing
splendid service.</p>

<p>Miss Elder reports that &#8220;many of the
mothers, having gained confidence in us, come
again for advice and medicine for themselves
and their children.&#8221; Speaking of a case she
visited, she says: &#8220;I had prepared a nice basin
of warm water, and was just ready to put
&#8216;baby&#8217; in for his first bath, when two women<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
rushed up, one on either side. Baby&#8217;s bath
was, to their way of thinking, not yet complete.
One poured in alcohol, and the other a large
cupful of greasy soup.</p>

<p>&#8220;On asking the reason of this, I was told it
was to make baby strong! So, with a smile and
the remark that I had not heard of the custom,
I proceeded with my work. This took place
in the house of one of the upper-class people.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I want to give you a peep into some
of the poorer &#8216;homes.&#8217; We were conducted to
a little shop where our patient lay on sheep-skins.
Baby&#8217;s wardrobe consisted only of a
strawberry-coloured knitted vest and a bonnet
of royal blue! On another occasion, to reach
my patient I passed through two courtyards,
and stepped down into a dark room.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was no window. The light entered
only through the doorway, and the round
hole in the wall through which the smoke
was expected to escape. The floor was alive
with guinea-pigs running to and fro. A few<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
fowls were roosting in one corner, on sticks
placed there for the purpose, while a mother
hen sheltered her brood of healthy chicks in
another. This patient had a bedstead, but it
was composed of rough irregular boards placed
together like a raft.</p>

<p>&#8220;In addition to the work in Cuzco we have
to hold ourselves ready for outside calls. I
was summoned one day to Urco Farm, because
of an accident to Domingo, a little Chuncho
Indian boy from the forests. I left Cuzco at
ten at night, on horseback.</p>

<p>&#8220;Darkness and the roughness of the road
hindered our progress, but we arrived early in
the morning. The boy had fallen from his
horse, cutting his face badly, while one eye
was completely lost. We gave him chloroform
and put in five stitches, and the little chap soon
got well again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Urco Farm is about five hundred miles
from the coast. For the first one hundred
miles it is desert, and the rest of the way<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
beautiful valleys. The climate is grand. The
farm is so large that it would take many days
to see over it all. There is abundance of fruit,
with large quantities of vegetables such as we
have here at home. There are horses for
riding, oxen for work, and mules, donkeys and
llamas for carrying goods. There are cattle
for meat, and sheep also; for milk and butter
there are goats.&#8221;</p>

<p>There are no roads here, but just mountain
trails. Everything is carried on llamas and
mules, while you would ride on a horse.</p>

<p>There are over two hundred Indians on the
farm, and the Mission is hoping to establish
an Orphanage here, like the one at Sao Paulo
in Brazil, only much larger. Mr Ganton
says:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Down this valley to the Amazon, and
thence to the Atlantic, over three thousand
miles, we know of no missionary! Within our
reach are possibly ten tribes of Indians untouched
even by Romanism. In our own<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
valley there are probably forty thousand
people.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have some fine boys, and the Indians
are very interesting. Mrs Stockwell is glad to
have her little school. The boys are quite
apt at learning texts. Almost any night we
can hear them spelling out passages from the
New Testament by candle-light in their little
rooms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our farm work is very interesting, also
our people. One soon learns to have a real
love for them. It is hard for the Indian
to understand why anyone should treat him
kindly without a selfish motive.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the school work the Indian children
are gathered together in the evenings and
taught. They attend willingly and gladly.
&#8220;The scholars are all ages and sizes, from the
ragged little Indian of six upwards. There are
some very promising children in the school,
and we hope that some day they will become
messengers of the Gospel to their own people<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
in the remote villages. Every day we see
more the need of the Orphanage, where the
children will be under our direct influence. We
have four already living in the house, and
what a difference we see compared to those
outside!</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs Stockwell is just in her glory with
the children, and is completely devoted to her
school. She is at work from early morning
until bedtime, and always making clothing
for the children.</p>

<p>&#8220;Day-school work among native children
in Lima is a very special feature. This was
begun in 1913, and a Scripture lesson was
always included in the day&#8217;s teaching. It is
being proved here, as in Argentina and elsewhere,
that not only does the day-school
deliver the Sunday-school scholars from annoyance,
persecution, and priestly instruction, but
it is also an excellent feeder for the Sunday-school,
at which the attendance marked a
great improvement in numbers and steadiness.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>&#8220;Under the very able superintendence and
help of Mrs Millham, there are two native
mistresses, who have been associated with the
Church for some long time.&#8221;</p>

<p>This school work amongst the native children
of Lima has been laid upon the workers
of the Evangelical Union of South America as
a sacred burden. It is their privilege&mdash;not
only in Peru but in the other Republics in
which they work&mdash;to lift the child out of its
ignorance, and to teach it to know Christ the
Friend of little children, to know the world
and all that pertains to it, and to know its
own heart.</p>

<p>We will not proceed any further in our wanderings,
for in Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela,
and Panama the same sad condition of things
prevails.</p>

<p>We have heard, not unmoved I trust, the
wail of the Indian children in the forests of
Peru and Brazil, and have seen them in the
Amazon valley. We have watched them with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
painful interest and concern in the streets of
the various cities, children of all colours and
nationalities, and yet all of one blood with us,
who call for our sympathies, our prayers, our
gifts, and above all, our love. They call to
us out of their deep need from the Land of
Opportunity.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&trade;
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&trade;&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&trade; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&trade; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&trade; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&trade; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg&trade;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
